# Basic RP2040 Rust I2C Master Example

This is an extremely basic example on how to do the following:

* Blink an LED (Pico only, Pico W LED is elsewhere)
* Set up an I2C master
* Write an incrementing number to the SSD1306

All of this is cobbled together from examples elsewhere, particularly docs.rs.

Environment:
* RPI Pico and RPI Pico W
* SSD1306 OLED Featherwing
* I2CDriver to monitor I2C activity
